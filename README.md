### Data Set Introduction: [Amtrak On-Time Performance](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/amtrak-on-time-performance)
The dataset I would like to introduce is the Amtrak On-Time Performance published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The U.S. Department of Transportation uses data collected from AmTrak reports to rate the on-time performance of trains defined as "the percentage of customers who arrive at their detraining stations on time." The last monthly report value calculated for December 2024 was 80.1%. The source data for this report comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation's "Monthly Transportation Statistics" which was last updated on August 28, 2025 and contains 944 rows and 136 columns with various federal level transportation data.

A big use case for this data is to help predict for customers when trains are more or less likely to be late. In December 2024, if the on-time performance rate was only 80.1% that means that 19.9% of trains did not arrive on time. If customers could see any trends or patterns happening here it might help them plan ahead better for their travels.

### Book Introduction: ["Modeling with Data: Tools and Techniques for Scientific Computing"](http://modelingwithdata.org/about_the_book.html)
The book I would like to introduce is "Modeling with Data: Tools and Techniques for Scientific Computing" by Ben Klemmens which introduces practical tools and examples for various forms of data manipulation. I am interested in this book because I like the idea of reading through real examples that help make sense of the concepts presented. Additionally, it covers a wide range of topics as opposed to just focusing on one thing.
